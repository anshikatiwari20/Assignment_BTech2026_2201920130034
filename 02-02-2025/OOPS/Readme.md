# Problem: Java Iterator

## Problem Statement
You need to complete the method `func` which takes an `ArrayList` as input. The `ArrayList` contains:

1. One or more integers.
2. A special string `"###"`.
3. One or more other strings.

Your task is to modify the `func` method so that it returns an `Iterator` that starts from the element after `"###"`. You can modify at most two lines of code.

### Example Input
```
element[0] => 42
element[1] => 10
element[2] => "###"
element[3] => "Hello"
element[4] => "Java"
```

### Expected Output
```
Hello
Java
```

## Solution Approach
1. **Iterate through the list:** Use an `Iterator` to traverse the `ArrayList`.
2. **Find the special string:** Use `instanceof String` to detect when `"###"` appears.
3. **Break the loop:** Stop when `"###"` is found so that the next call to `Iterator` starts from the required position.
